## NB model

NB model: No dependency btw features.

TANB model: One more dependency to other feature

In NB model: Y-\>M Y-\>S

```{R}
ps1y1 = psn1y1=ps1yn1=psn1yn1 = 0.5

# our query: P(Y|M=1, S=1)?
# P(Y|M=1, S=1)  = P(Y, M=1, S=1)/P(Y)
# this thing is proportional to P(Y)P(M=1|Y)P(S=1|Y)

In TANB model: Y-\>M, Y-\>S, **M-\>S**
```{R}
